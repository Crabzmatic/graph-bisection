# graph-bisection
Algorithm for graph partitioning approximation

Made with _ba-graph_ library.

Function _doBisection()_ returns a set of vertices that belong to the bisecton.
This function was done for cubic graphs, mainly.

Function _findCutSize()_ will work on any graph, with any k-way partitioning.
